# Computer Science Named Entity Recognition in the Open Research Knowledge Graph (CS-NER dataset)


This work proposes a standardized CS-NER task by defining a set of seven _contribution-centric_ scholarly
entities for CS NER viz., _research problem_ , _solution_ , _resource_ , _language_ ,
_tool_ , _method_ , and _dataset_ . 

The main contributions are:

1) Combines [FTD dataset](https://aclanthology.org/I11-1001/), 
combines existing CS NER resources that maintain their annotation focus on the set or subset of contribution-centric scholarly entities we consider;
further, noting the need for big data to train neural NER models, this work additionally supplies thousands of contribution-centric entity
annotations from article titles and abstracts, thus releasing a cumulative
large novel resource for CS NER
