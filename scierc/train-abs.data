Thus	O

We	O
incorporate	O
the	O

that	O

have	O
a	O

Our	O

more	O

In	O

we	O
propose	O

this	O

from	O
three	O
perspectives:	O
(1)	O
Instead	O

the	O
most	O

(2)	O
Rather	O
than	O
learning	O
from	O
only	O

the	O

(3)	O

All	O
three	O
ideas	O
are	O
implemented	O
in	O
a	O

semi-supervised	O

with	O
ability	O

the	O

In	O
this	O
paper,	O
we	O
propose	O
a	O
new	O
approach	O
to	O
generate	O
oriented	B-RESEARCH_PROBLEM
object	I-RESEARCH_PROBLEM
proposals	I-RESEARCH_PROBLEM
(OOPs)	E-RESEARCH_PROBLEM
to	O
reduce	O
the	O
detection	O
error	O
caused	O
by	O
various	O
orientations	O
of	O
the	O
object.	O
To	O
this	O
end,	O
we	O
propose	O
to	O
efficiently	O
locate	O
object	O
regions	O
according	O
to	O
pixelwise	O
object	O
probability,	O
rather	O
than	O
measuring	O
the	O
objectness	O
from	O
a	O
set	O
of	O
sampled	O
windows.	O
We	O
formulate	O
the	O
proposal	B-RESEARCH_PROBLEM
generation	I-RESEARCH_PROBLEM
problem	E-RESEARCH_PROBLEM
as	O
a	O
generative	O
proba-bilistic	O
model	O
such	O
that	O
object	O
proposals	O
of	O
different	O
shapes	O
(i.e.,	O
sizes	O
and	O
orientations)	O
can	O
be	O
produced	O
by	O
locating	O
the	O
local	O
maximum	O
likelihoods.	O
The	O
new	O
approach	O
has	O
three	O
main	O
advantages.	O
First,	O
it	O
helps	O
the	O
object	O
detector	O
handle	O
objects	O
of	O
different	O
orientations.	O
Second,	O
as	O
the	O
shapes	O
of	O
the	O
proposals	O
may	O
vary	O
to	O
fit	O
the	O
objects,	O
the	O
resulting	O
proposals	O
are	O
tighter	O
than	O
the	O
sampling	O
windows	O
with	O
fixed	O
sizes.	O
Third,	O
it	O
avoids	O
massive	O
window	O
sampling,	O
and	O
thereby	O
reducing	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
proposals	O
while	O
maintaining	O
a	O
high	O
recall.	O
Experiments	O
on	O
the	O
PASCAL	O

2007	O
dataset	O
show	O
that	O
the	O
proposed	O
OOP	O
outperforms	O
the	O
state-of-the-art	O
fast	O
methods.	O
Further	O
experiments	O
show	O
that	O
the	O
rotation	O
invariant	O
property	O
helps	O
a	O
class-specific	O
object	O
detector	O
achieve	O
better	O
performance	O
than	O
the	O
state-of-the-art	O
proposal	O

methods	O
in	O
either	O
object	O
rotation	O
scenarios	O
or	O
general	O
scenarios.	O
Generating	O
OOPs	S-RESEARCH_PROBLEM
is	O
very	O
fast	O
and	O
takes	O
only	O
0.5s	O

image.	O

We	O
study	O
the	O
question	O
of	O
how	O
to	O
make	O
loss-aware	B-RESEARCH_PROBLEM
predictions	E-RESEARCH_PROBLEM
in	O
image	B-RESEARCH_PROBLEM

the	O

that	O

Currently,	O
there	O
are	O
two	O
dominant	O
approaches:	O
the	O
first	O
approximates	O
the	O
Expected-IoU	O
(EIoU)	O
score	O
as	O
Expected-Intersection-over-Expected-Union	O
(EIoEU);	O
and	O
the	O
second	O
approach	O
is	O
to	O
compute	O
exact	O
EIoU	O
but	O
only	O
over	O
a	O
small	O
set	O
of	O
high-quality	O
candidate	O
solutions.	O
We	O
begin	O
by	O
asking	O
which	O
approach	O
we	O
should	O
favor	O
for	O
two	O
typical	O
image	B-RESEARCH_PROBLEM

.	O
Studying	O
this	O
question	O
leads	O
to	O
two	O
new	O
methods	O
that	O
draw	O
ideas	O
from	O
both	O
existing	O
approaches.	O
Our	O
new	O
methods	O
use	O
the	O
EIoEU	O
approximation	O
paired	O
with	O
high	O
quality	O
candidate	O
solutions.	O
Experimentally	O
we	O
show	O
that	O
our	O
new	O
approaches	O
lead	O
to	O
improved	O
performance	O
on	O
both	O

In	O
this	O
paper,	O
we	O
aim	O
to	O
automatically	O
render	O
aging	O
faces	O
in	O
a	O
personalized	O
way.	O
Basically,	O
a	O
set	O
of	O
age-group	O
specific	O
dictionaries	O
are	O
learned,	O
where	O
the	O
dictionary	O
bases	O
corresponding	O
to	O
the	O
same	O
index	O
yet	O
from	O
different	O
dictionaries	O
form	O
a	O
particular	O
aging	B-RESEARCH_PROBLEM

pattern	O
cross	O
different	O
age	O
groups,	O
and	O
a	O

of	O
these	O
patterns	O
expresses	O
a	O
particular	O

process	E-RESEARCH_PROBLEM
.	O
Moreover,	O
two	O
factors	O
are	O
taken	O
into	O
consideration	O
in	O
the	O
dictionary	O
learning	O
process.	O
First,	O
beyond	O
the	O
aging	O
dictionaries,	O
each	O
subject	O
may	O
have	O
extra	O
personalized	O
facial	O
characteristics,	O
e.g.	O
mole,	O
which	O
are	O
invariant	O
in	O
the	O
aging	O
process.	O
Second,	O
it	O
is	O
challenging	O
or	O
even	O
impossible	O
to	O
collect	O
faces	O
of	O
all	O
age	O
groups	O
for	O
a	O
particular	O
subject,	O
yet	O
much	O
easier	O
and	O
more	O
practical	O
to	O
get	O
face	O

from	O

Thus	O
a	O

is	O
utilized	O
to	O
learn	O
the	O
dictionaries	O
based	O

age	O
