Specifically,	O

selects	O

Finally,	O

For	O

Most	O

as	O
their	O
basic	O
framework,	O
which	O
regard	O
it	O

an	O

However,	O

Inspired	O
by	O
the	O
habit	O
of	O
observing	O

by	O
the	O
human,	O
we	O
propose	O
a	O
new	O
method	O
by	O
comparing	O
the	O
initial	O
proposals	O
and	O
the	O
extension	O
ones	O
to	O
optimize	O
those	O
initial	O
proposals.	O
Specifically,	O
we	O
propose	O
one	O
new	O
strategy	O
for	O
WSOD	O
by	O
involving	O
contrastive	O
proposal	O
extension	O
(CPE),	O
which	O
consists	O
of	O
multiple	O
directional	O
contrastive	O
proposal	O
extensions	O
(D-CPE),	O
and	O
each	O
D-CPE	O
contains	O
encoders	O
based	O
on	O
LSTM	O
network	O
and	O
corresponding	O
decoders.	O
Firstly,	O
the	O
boundary	O
of	O
initial	O
proposals	O
in	O
MIL	O
is	O
extended	O
to	O
different	O
positions	O
according	O
to	O
well-designed	O
sequential	O
order.	O
Then,	O
CPE	O
compares	O
the	O
extended	O
proposal	O
and	O
the	O
initial	O
proposal	O
by	O
extracting	O
the	O
feature	O
semantics	O
of	O
them	O
using	O
the	O
encoders,	O
and	O
calculates	O
the	O
integrity	O
of	O
the	O
initial	O
proposal	O
to	O
optimize	O
the	O
score	O
of	O
the	O
initial	O
proposal.	O
These	O
contrastive	O
contextual	O
semantics	O
will	O
guide	O
the	O
basic	O
WSOD	O
to	O
suppress	O
bad	O
proposals	O
and	O
improve	O
the	O
scores	O

ones.	O
In	O

a	O

(iii)	O

First,	O
we	O

Second,	O
we	O
design	O

them,	O

the	O

is	O

as	O
it	O
only	O

Here,	O
we	O
attempt	O
to	O
employ	O

our	O

We	O
use	O

we	O

that	O

Because	O

Third,	O

We	O

A	O

A	O

However,	O

the	O

The	O

while	O
preserving	O
the	O

The	O

the	O
three	O

The	O

furthermore	O
shows	O
that	O
the	O

Many	O

both	O

may	O
benefit	O
from	O
a	O

that	O

For	O

in	O
neuro-imaging	O

the	O

may	O
be	O
restricted	O
to	O
a	O

(spatial	O

while	O
exhibiting	O
a	O
smooth	O
response	O
within	O
that	O
region.	O
We	O
propose	O
a	O
unified	O
approach	O
to	O
regularized	O
PCA	O
which	O
can	O
induce	O
both	O
sparsity	O
and	O
smoothness	O
in	O
both	O
the	O
row	O
and	O

principal	O
components.	O
Our	O
framework	O
generalizes	O
much	O
of	O
the	O
previous	O
literature,	O
with	O
sparse,	O

two-way	O
sparse,	O
and	O

all	O
being	O
special	O
cases	O
of	O
our	O
approach.	O
Our	O
method	O
permits	O
flexible	O
combinations	O
of	O
sparsity	O
and	O
smoothness	O
that	O
lead	O
to	O
improvements	O
in	O

selection	O
and	O
signal	O
recovery,	O
as	O

as	O

We	O
demonstrate	O
the	O
efficacy	O
of	O
our	O
method	O
on	O
simulated	O

and	O
a	O
neuroimaging	O

The	O

as	O
it	O

However,	O
the	O
retinal	O

cells	O
in	O
the	O
biological	O
visual	O
system	O
have	O
approximately	O
concentric	O

Motivated	O
by	O
this	O
observation,	O
we	O
propose	O
using	O
the	O
circular	O
kernel	O
with	O
a	O
concentric	O
and	O
isotropic	O
receptive	O
field	O
as	O
an	O
option	O
for	O

operation.	O
We	O
first	O
substitute	O
the	O
$3	O

3$	O
square	O
kernels	O
with	O
the	O
corresponding	O
circular	O
kernels	O
or	O
our	O
proposed	O
integrated	O
kernels	O
in	O
the	O
typical	O

and	O
the	O
modified	O
models	O
after	O
training	O
yield	O
similar	O
or	O
even	O

performance.	O
We	O
then	O
show	O
the	O
advantages	O
of	O
large	O
circular	O
kernels	O
over	O
the	O
corresponding	O
square	O
kernels	O
in	O
that	O
the	O
difference	O
and	O
the	O

are	O
more	O
distinct.	O
Hence,	O
we	O
speculate	O
that	O

would	O
help	O

To	O

we	O

the	O

in	O
several	O

methods	O
with	O
convolutions	O
of	O

Experimental	O

that	O

significantly	O
outperform	O
the	O

The	O
additional	O

also	O
reveals	O
that	O
the	O

help	O
the	O

Towards	O

Furthermore,	O

The	O

essentially	O
a	O
joint	O
language	O
model	O
conditioned	O
on	O
both	O
the	O

Therefore,	O
the	O
NMT	O
model	O
naturally	O
involves	O
the	O
mechanism	O

(LM)	O
that	O

still	O
suffers	O
from	O
the	O

inadequate	O

The	O
main	O
reason	O
is	O
that	O
NMT	O
pays	O

to	O
the	O

namely	O

Accordingly,	O
we	O
define	O
the	O
Margin	O
between	O
the	O

and	O
the	O
LM,	O
calculated	O
by	O
subtracting	O
the	O

the	O

from	O
that	O
of	O

The	O
Margin	O
is	O
negatively	O

to	O
the	O

degree	O
of	O
the	O
LM.	O
Based	O
on	O
the	O

we	O
propose	O
a	O
Margin-based	O

Objective	O
(MTO)	O
and	O
a	O
Margin-based	O

However,	O

In	O

we	O

First,	O

This	O

Secondly,	O

that	O

(3)	O
How	O

what	O

For	O

question,	O
we	O

the	O

all	O

Graph	B-RESEARCH_PROBLEM

(DGE).	O
The	O
assumption	O
underlying	O
our	O
model	O
is	O
that	O
a	O
sequence	O
of	O
images	O
can	O
be	O
represented	O
by	O
a	O
graph	O
that	O
encodes	O
both	O

The	O
key	O
novelty	O
of	O
DGE	O
is	O
to	O
learn	O
jointly	O
the	O
graph	O
and	O
its	O
graph	O

At	O
its	O
core,	O
DGE	O
works	O
by	O
iterating	O
over	O
two	O
steps:	O
1)	O
updating	O
the	O
graph	O
representing	O
the	O
semantic	O
and	O
temporal	O
similarity	O
of	O
the	O

based	O

2)	O
updating	O
the	O
data	O
representation	O
to	O
take	O
into	O
account	O
the	O

structure.	O
The	O
main	O
advantage	O
of	O
DGE	O
over	O
state-of-the-art	O
self-supervised	O
approaches	O
is	O
that	O
it	O
does	O

instead	O

iteratively	O

the	O

that	O

the	O

Furthermore,	O

also	O

These	O

enable	O

We	O
quantize	O

Our	O

taking	O

We	O
also	O

We	O

We	O

for	O
the	O

Despite	O
this,	O
most	O

treat	O
the	O

which	O

they	O

In	O
this	O

we	O
introduce	O
a	O
Detection-based	O

Image-to-image	O

(DUNIT)	O
approach	O
that	O
explicitly	O
accounts	O
for	O
the	O

in	O
the	O

process.	O
To	O
this	O
end,	O
we	O
extract	O
separate	O
representations	O
for	O
the	O
global	O

and	O
for	O

which	O
we	O
then	O
fuse	O
into	O
a	O
common	O
representation	O
from	O
which	O
we	O
generate	O
the	O

This	O
allows	O

to	O

We	O
introduce	O
an	O

to	O
maintain	O
the	O

between	O
the	O

Furthermore,	O
by	O
incorporating	O

into	O
our	O

we	O
can	O

exploit	O

As	O

this	O
allows	O
us	O
to	O
outperform	O
the	O
state-of-the-art	O

Furthermore,	O

also	O
be	O

as	O

Firstly,	O
we	O

of	O
the	O

a	O

of	O
the	O

that	O

Secondly,	O
we	O
add	O
an	O
additional	O
frequency	O

as	O

for	O
the	O

and	O
we	O
show	O
its	O
effect	O
on	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

Finally,	O
we	O
make	O
a	O
profound	O
study	O
of	O
how	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
final	O

in	O
the	O

We	O

the	O

that	O

that	O

During	O

A	O

When	O

We	O

Then,	O

These	O

interestingly,	O
the	O

We	O
devise	O
a	O

The	O

This	O

We	O

We	O

since	O

To	O
this	O

we	O
propose	O

newly-unified	O
DA	O
framework	O
(i.e.,	O
Importance	O

,	O
IFCDA).	O
Firstly,	O
an	O
importance	O
filtered	O
mechanism	O
is	O
devised	O
to	O
generate	O
filtered	O
soft	O
labels	O
to	O
mitigate	O
negative	O

desirably.	O
Specifically,	O
the	O
soft	O
labels	O
are	O
divided	O
into	O
confident	O
and	O
ambiguous	O
ones.	O
Then,	O
only	O
the	O
maximum	O
probability	O
in	O
each	O
confident	O
label	O
is	O
retained,	O
and	O
a	O
threshold	O
value	O
is	O
set	O
to	O
truncate	O
each	O
ambiguous	O
label	O
so	O
that	O
only	O
prominent	O
probabilities	O
are	O
reserved.	O
Moreover,	O
a	O
general	O
graph-based	O
label	O
propagation	O
is	O
contrived	O
to	O
attain	O
soft	O
labels	O
in	O
both	O
CSDA	O
and	O
OSDA,	O
where	O
an	O
extra	O
component	O
is	O
embedded	O
into	O
label	O
vector,	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
could	O
detect	O
target	O
novel	O
classes.	O
Finally,	O
the	O
category-relevant	O
losses	O
in	O
both	O
scenarios	O
are	O
reformulated	O
using	O
filtered	O
soft	O
labels,	O
while	O
the	O
category-irrelevant	O
MMD	O
loss	O
in	O
CSDA	O
is	O
reformulated	O
as	O
a	O
form	O
like	O
class-wise	O
MMD	O
using	O
newly-designed	O
importance	O
filtered	O
soft	O
labels.	O
Notably,	O
CSDA	O
paradigm	O
is	O
a	O
special	O
case	O
when	O
all	O
extra	O
components	O
are	O
set	O

thus	O
the	O
