A	O
propositional	O

a	O

is	O
used	O
to	O
express	O
that	O
the	O

in	O
the	O

Secondly,	O
each	O

has	O
its	O
own	O

i.e.	O
a	O

in	O

The	O

are	O
the	O

We	O

(i.e.	O

It	O

In	O
this	O

we	O

an	O

whether	O
a	O

Using	O

it	O

how	O
to	O

the	O

the	O

We	O
solve	O
this	O

with	O
a	O
two-step	O

First,	O
we	O
transform	O
the	O

into	O
a	O
new	O

using	O

Then,	O
we	O
build	O
the	O
base	O
clas-sifiers	O
with	O
the	O
new	O

We	O
propose	O
two	O
